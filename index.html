<p>Tver River Terminal or Tverskoy rechnoy vokzal (Russian: Тверской речной вокзал) is a partially destroyed passenger terminal of river transport in Tver. It is situated at the confluence of the Volga and Tvertsa rivers, on the left bank of the Volga, just near the river mouth of Tvertsa.
The construction began in 1935, near the site of the demolished Otroch Uspensky Monastery, and was completed by 1938. Both architects and most of the workers on site were prisoners of the Volgolag labour camp (part of the Gulag).
Because of the compromises and corner-cutting made during the planning and construction, the building's structure began to decline by the end of 1980s. Due to the financial difficulties that city experienced in 1990s and early 2000s, local authorities were unable to afford proper repairs, which lead to further deterioration.
By that time, following the decline of water transport in the region, the river terminal building was out of the commission for almost a decade. In the following years, up until 2011, it was sometimes used as a venue for art expositions, while some of the sections were rented out to various tenants.</p>
On the eve of August 7, 2017, main building began collapsing—a process that continued on the next day, eventually leading to the loss of external walls, floor structures and the roof.
